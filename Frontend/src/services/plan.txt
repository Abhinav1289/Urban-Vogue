### Comprehensive Plan for Setting Up Login and AuthContext

#### Information Gathered:
- The `AuthContext.tsx` file manages the authentication state and fetches the current user from the API endpoint `/auth/me`.
- The `Login.tsx` file handles user login by sending a POST request to the `/auth/login` endpoint and updates the user context upon successful login.
- The `apiRequest.ts` file configures Axios for making API requests, with a base URL pointing to the backend API.

#### Plan:
1. **AuthContext Setup**:
   - Ensure the `AuthContext` is properly set up to manage the current user state and provide methods to update the user.

2. **Login Component**:
   - Verify that the `Login` component correctly handles form submission and error management.
   - Ensure that the login request is sent to the correct endpoint and that the response is handled appropriately.

3. **API Request Handling**:
   - Confirm that the Axios instance in `apiRequest.ts` is correctly configured to handle requests, including setting the base URL and enabling credentials.

#### Follow-up Steps:
- Test the login functionality to ensure that users can log in successfully and that the current user state is updated in the context.
- Verify that error messages are displayed correctly when login fails.
