### Plan:
1. **Review the `Program.cs` file**:
   - Ensure that the JWT authentication is correctly configured and that the necessary services are registered.

2. **Examine the `appsettings.json` file**:
   - Verify the JWT settings (Key, Issuer, Audience) to ensure they are correctly set up for authentication.

3. **Check the Services**:
   - Review the `LoginService`, `UserService`, and `JwtService` to ensure they are correctly implementing their respective interfaces and handling user authentication and token generation properly.

4. **Review Controllers**:
   - Examine the `AuthController` to ensure it is correctly handling authentication requests and returning appropriate responses.

5. **Testing**:
   - After making any necessary changes, run the application and test the authentication flow to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

### Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `Program.cs`
- `appsettings.json`
- Services (`LoginService`, `UserService`, `JwtService`)
- Controllers (`AuthController`)

### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Conduct tests to ensure that the authentication process works correctly.
